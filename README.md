Welcome to our cool project for the Hackathon IML 2021 in HUJI. Our goal for this project was to predict the revenue and ranking of movies. 

We have organized the project into the following folders:

- **Data**: This folder contains all the data files in CSV format that we have used to train and test our models.
- **Docs**: This folder contains all the relevant text files such as the README and the license file.
- **Figures**: This folder contains all the figures used in the project. We have also included the functions used to generate these figures.
- **Script**: This folder contains all the scripts for our project. The `regression.py` file includes the `predict` function, which is the API function required to predict the revenues and votes of movies given a CSV file. The `regression_class.py` file contains the pre-processing code, the definition of the machine learning model, and the saving of the model object as a binary file. 

Please keep the folders and files in their respective places to ensure that everything runs smoothly. Thank you for visiting our project!
